This directory gives the configuration for the Karma test runner.
Karma runs the Jasmine tests defined in the privly-applications
module on browsers you have defined locally or on Sauce labs.

## Setup ##

> npm install -g karma-cli && npm install

## Running ##

To run karma locally:

> karma start

To run karma on Sauce labs, 
you must first associate your machine with Sauce Labs (see below), then

> karma start karma.conf-ci.js

For more details on how this was setup, see:
